It is commonly asked question by the interviewer that 

Suppose you are leading a team or you are a manager and people under you are not working, what will you do ?

First , try to ask what is the main cause that they are not working . If the reason is valid like they don't 
understand work properly or not given trainings about the work or team members make him/her uncomfortable or 
he/she is not able to co-operate with them due to some other reasons etc etc. 
then work on the cause. 

Provide extra help or mentor to push them. Help them to grow . If still he/she don't able to work that means its not his/her
field then try to figure out in what field he is good and put him/her in that field so that he/she can grow. If there is 
problem with team members then change the team or etc etc.


This question is asked to check how you handle the situation. And situation can be handled by recognising the cause of problem.
If main cause of problem is recognised then solution can be provided easily.


This question is totally situational question. So, you could also ask the interviewer to clear the exact scenario.
