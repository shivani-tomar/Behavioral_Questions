Could I have beer with you ?

This question may be asked to know your point of views about beer or alchohol.

If you have not touched beer before then you can say , 

It will be my first time to have beer with you . I never tasted it before. Lets try it .


If your exploration is limited about alcohols then you can say : -

I have tried this this this variety  and want to try something new . Are you going to offer me to red wine or some other 
variety name.


If you have good knowledge about alcohols and drinks then you can say : - 

dash beer tastes awesome and it is in dash bar . It is famous for it. If you don't mind then we both can try this one.




                                                    OR

If your principles don't allow you to do so then you can say . I am sorry sir/ mam , I don't drink if you want then carry on
I don't mind it. or you could explain this : - 

Sir , if you don't mind , can we spend this money on the education of children who can't afford it or spend money on
social welfare so that they can rise.

Second one is more impressive as it is not only hiding that you hate who drink even it shows that you are socially aware
person.
