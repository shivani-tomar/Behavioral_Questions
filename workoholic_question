I am workoholic ? Are you compatible with me?

This question is asked by the interviewer to check whether you are a team player or not or what will you do if 
your team leader have a lots of work.

If somebody askes you this question then have a very innocent smile on your face and say to him or her ....

Sir/ Mam  , How can I help you in your work so that you finish it as soon as possible and we will have party together.

                                                Or


How could I reduce your work.

                                                Or


Could I have some of your work please.

Last answer is short and sufficient enough to tell that you are a team player.
