Do you believe in God or any supreme power? 

This is truth that there is a supreme power who is handling everyone . And I believe in praying God for what He has 
given to us and request Him to make His world better. But I don't believe in blind trusts which are used to earn money 
or doing bad using the name of God or reading books which you don't understand or having forehead mark with tilak or 
showing that I believe in God. It is only trust which binds human to God which is generated by actions.

God has no name , no body , vo voice like human. 

Every human is God who is working for goodness.
