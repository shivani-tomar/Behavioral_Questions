How would you see yourself after 5 years or after particular time ?

This question is rarely asked by the interviewers but still there is a propability of asking this question. Through 
this question they want to know about your goals and aims.

Don't tell them that you will be at this post or do this or will become this. They will consider you as a competition
of them. And it will make a bad impression of yours on them.

Tell them that you will be in your comfort zone on a particular technology and will be able to handle any type 
problems on that particular technology.
