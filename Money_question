Why we give you so much high salary ? or why you deserve that much of salary?

This is very tricky question as everybody wants money but you cannot tell an organization that you only work for money.
This will highlights that you are not thinking about organization's growth and only thinking about yourself.

Even you cannot show that you deserve money because you need it or your family background is not so much strong or you are poor.
You cannot beg it as you are well educated.

You can explain to them that how it will create a big difference in his/her life style and change his/her life.
And set an example to others how education change one's life and promote others to have good and right education. 
While explaining all these things, make them to feel special by telling them that they are the big contributor in 
growth of society and economy of the world and giving the right thing to right person.
